# Iris-Project
This is a Machine learning Model used to distinguish between different Iris .It uses Iris-Dataset imported from sklearn.dataset.
</br>
It uses four Features to differentiate between targets :-
</br>
1. Sepal Length(cm)
2. Sepal Width(cm)
3. Petal Length(cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)
</br>
It distinguishes Three targets namely:-
</br>
1. Setosa
2. Versicolor
3. Varginica
</br>
It uses the train_test_split function to split the available dataset into the Training(75%) and Testing(25%) model.
</br>
Algorithm Used:-
</br>
KNeighborClassifier(kNN)
</br>
Number of neighbors =3
</br>
It used Pandas Dataframe and mglearn Library to plot and visualize the relationship between two of four features of the dataset.
